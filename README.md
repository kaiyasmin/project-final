The Sephora Skincare Bestsellers Explorer

This Sephora Skincare Bestsellers Explorer was made to help people get acquainted with skincare in an accessible and informed way. Skincare is the biggest segment in the beauty industry (more than make-up!) with its global sales expected to cross $130 billion by 2019. (https://www.euromonitor.com/the-future-of-skin-care-game-changing-trends-and-influencers/report). 
Sephora is the most popular beauty store in America, and the most accessible, with an online store and thousands of physical stores across the country, so I based my app on the products available on their website. 

This app addresses three key issues that pose a barrier to potential customers - accessibility, education, and the rising concern about clean cosmetic standards. 

1. Accessibility.  There is a wide interest in skincare, but creating a skincare routine from scratch can be overwhelming, due to the wide variety of options. The Korean skincare routine is popular but it has 10 steps of product which is seen as time-consuming and expensive to beginners. This application breaks down the bestsellers reviews of every category of product, so you can see for yourself if a product lives up to the hype, or whether you really need that expensive exfoliator, or if you can go with another brand that is just as good? I aim to bring transparency to the bestseller list through review breakdown. People end up purchasing when they feel that they are well-informed. 

2. Education. Skincare is unlike makeup in that it is more like science than art. Everyone has their own skin micro biome, so things that may work for others may not work for you, and everyone has different concerns, for example, anti-aging, or oily skin. Every product has a link to SkinCarisma.com, which points out if an ingredient has super-star or toxic ingredients, or if an ingredient is great for a certain issue. People are becoming more picky with what they put in their bodies and on their skin. 

Besides from seeing if the ingredients will actually work for you, the app provides education on building a simple skincare routine from scratch, and provides tips for layering products. Skincare is science - if a beginner layers too many active products at once, it can cause serious damage. For example, layering an AHA or BHA exfoliating acid with an anti-aging Retinoid can burn or flake your skin as it disrupts the pH balance of your skin barrier. 

3. Clean choices. While the skincare industry is the biggest segment in the beauty market, it is also one of the most unregulated, meaning that the FDA takes a hands off approach when it comes to monitoring ingredients that go into products. With the rise of hormone related health issues, such as breast cancer and poly cystic ovary syndrome, the fact that skincare can contain hormone or endocrine disruptors is disturbing, especially as it is women that are making up most of the market. 

Sephora has recently started to give products with clean ingredients a “Clean at Sephora” seal, meaning that they are free of “sulfates SLS and SLES, parabens, formaldehydes, formaldehyde-releasing agents, phthalates, mineral oil, retinyl palmitate, oxybenzone, coal tar, hydroquinone, triclosan, and triclocarban.”(https://www.sephora.com/clean-beauty-products). 

Aside from giving users a choice to view the products that have the seal and also see products that have parabens in them, it may also be an interesting insight for Sephora to see if a “Clean at Sephora” seal means anything for level of interest or star rating, compared to products without it.
